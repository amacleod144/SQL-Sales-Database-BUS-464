# SQL-Sales-Database-BUS-464-Project-
This repository contains the code for my Fall 2020 Project for my data management class. 
My class partner (Gunit Sethi) and I created a sales database for a videogame company. We wrote the SQL code for both the schema of the database as well as a number of queries to test its functionality.
Data for the database was generated using a combination of manual input and data generation site mockaroo.com
